Have you ever been down to Pike Place Market and seen the flying fish? It's an amazing attraction and people come from all over to see the show!

Enjoy a Salmon cookie as you walk downtown on the waterfront and let the flavor swim around in your mouth! Our hope is to go state wide and spread the love of our Salmon cookies to all of Washington! </p>
