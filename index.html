        <p>We are a new cookie shop, starting out in the Seattle area. Seattle is known for their world renowned seafood, especially when it comes to the pride we have for our Salmon. Have you ever been down to Pike Place Market and seen the flying fish? It's an amazing attraction and people come from all over to see the show! Well wanted to expand on that and come up with another attraction that would bring people from all over. Well thanks to our delicious Salmon we came up with an interestingly tasty treat! Salmon cookies are not like anything you have ever tasted before and you will be coming back for more! Bring your family on by and enjoy a Salmon cookie as you walk downtown on the waterfront and let the flavor swim around in your mouth! Our hope is to go state wide and spread the love of our Salmon cookies to all of Washington! </p>
